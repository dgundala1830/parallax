		<h2>"Blooming"</h2>
		<p>The young Moonflower stood alone in a garden. As it patiently waited to bloom, it felt the cool beams of light on its petals and slowly looked up to see something so grand and beautiful: the Moon. The two quickly became acquainted and the Moonflower felt loved and beautiful when the Moon came out after a long day of hiding. The Moon, in return, cherished the Moonflower for appreciating and basking in its beauty while most flowers craved for the Sun. A friendship had begun to bloom.</p>

		<h2>"Wilting"</h2>
		<p>The night turned into to day simply too fast. The Sun came out and the Moon went back into hiding. The Moonflower felt its petals slowly wilt and its stem began to fold. It missed the Moon dearly. No one appreciated the Moonflower besides its glowing friend, and no one missed the Moon more than the young Moonflower. Without the Moon's companionship and love, the young flower felt itself wilting.</p>

		<h2>"Best Friend"</h2>
		<p>Hours passed and the stars began to twinkle. The Moonflower hung its head low in sadness when it began to see its own shadow on the ground. It recognized the cool touch of light beams on its stem and after waiting all day it could not contain its excitement to see its best friend. Its petals turned upwards, its spine straightened, and it looked up. It was the Moon! The Moon glowed even brighter out of joy for seeing its friend. The Moonflower and Moon found one thing in each other that neither had before: a best friend. </p>
